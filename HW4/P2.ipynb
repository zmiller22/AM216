    "RB convection, in which a flow is heated from below and cooled  from  top,  is  one  of  the  paradigmatic  system  in  fluid  dynamics. When the temperature difference between the two plates (in dimensionless form Rayleigh number Ra) is beyond certain threshold, hot fluid tends to go up and cold fluid tends to go down, thus forming convection cells. What we supply here are the temperature snapshots from four different Ra, i.e., $Ra=10^{14}$ as `class0`,$Ra= 10^{13}$ as `class1`, $Ra= 10^{12}$ as `class2`,and $Ra= 10^{11}$ as `class3`.  The flow you see is highly turbulent; not only there are big convection cells but also lots of small vortices.  The original dataset  is  around  4000*2000.   We  have  already  downsampled  the  data into the zip file `fluid_org.zip`."
