    "In this homework problem, you are going to use `tensorflow-probability` to deal with an unfair dice, i.e., a dice that has different probability of settling with each of the face 1 to 6 facing up, instead of the $p=1/6$ equal probability in the case of a fair dice.\n",

    "You are provided with 5000 data entries of this dice. Each entry is a length-6 vector with one element being 1 and 0 for the rest. For example, $[0,1,0,0,0,0]$ means the \"2\" face of this dice landed facing up. This form is also the data form generated by `tfp.distribution.Bernoulli` when you feed multiple probability to it.\n",

We suspect that some of the die at the table are each weighted to land on one of these values more often than the others. To investigate, we have analyzed hours of casino floor film to get 5000 roll results of one particular die (giving our data above), and now we want to investigate if this die is weighted to 1, 4, or is unweighted. Let's make the prior for $\\vec{p}$ a Dirlechet distribution, and use three different $\\alpha$ paramaterizations to reflect our three prior beleifs. We will let all elements of $\\vec{\\alpha}$ equal 1 for the first paramaterization (prior beleif that die is not loaded), we will let $\\alpha_1=5$ with all others being 1 for the second paramaterization (prior beleif that the die is loaded to land on 1), and we will let $\\alpha_4=5$ with all others being 1 for the third paramaterization.\n",
